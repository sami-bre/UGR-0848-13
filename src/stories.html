            <p>
              Jordan was a student in my class during my second year of
              teaching. He'd often refuse to complete activities because he
              thought they were too hard, but I knew he was capable. After all,
              he was a bright, funny, and kind student - he just lacked
              confidence. I made it my mission to change his defeatist mindset
              over the course of the year. I encouraged Jordan, and praised him
              for his hard work and effort at every turn. But when he left my
              classroom at the end of the school year, I was left questioning if
              I had succeeded in my efforts. He had made amazing academic
              growth, but he still lacked confidence.
            </p>
            <p>
              Three years later, Jordan came down to my room to visit me. He
              said, "Mr. Boender, you always told me to do my best, and I just
              want to say thank you. Because of you, I am looking at becoming a
              teacher when I grow up."

            <h2 class="story__content__title">Meet Clyde</h2>
            <p>
              At age 17 with a learning disability, Clyde enrolled at Wisdom
              School with a history of academic struggles and unacceptable
              behaviors. He was often disrespectful to his teachers and peers
              and regularly did not attend class. As a result, he fell far
              behind in his schoolwork and became disengaged with school and was
              not on a path leading to graduation.
            </p>
            <p>
              In contrast, at Wisdom School, Clyde flourished. He was surrounded
              by teachers who worked with him one-on-one. They created an
              individualized education plan that prepared him for academic
              success. Clyde felt valued and respected by his teachers in a way
              he never had before.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, Clyde is a model student - he helps other students as a peer
              mentor and will graduate in June.

            <h2>Meet Charmayne</h2>
            <p>
              Charmayne enrolled at Wisdom School in fourth grade. At the time,
              her public school teachers and principals had written her off as
              unreachable and unteachable. “If I stayed at a regular public
              school, I would have gotten kicked out,” recalls Charmayne.
            </p>
            <p>
              But everything began to change when Charmayne got to Wisdom
              School. With a ratio of one staff member to every four students,
              personalized one-on-one counseling, mentoring and tutoring
              programs, and very small class sizes, Charmayne finally received
              the attention, guidance, and nurturing she needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              During her time at Wisdom, Charmayne went from being a young girl
              angry at the world to a young woman who is an accomplished writer,
              dancer, and student with specific goals and plans for her future.

            <h2>Meet Audreona</h2>
            <p>
              Audreona didn't fit in at her neighborhood school. She talked too
              much, asked too many questions, and had trouble controlling her
              impulses. As a result, her teachers decided she was a disruption
              and her classmates teased and bullied her.
            </p>
            <p>
              Everything changed for Audreona when she transferred to Wisdom
              School. With small class sizes, special attention from teachers,
              access to counselors, tutoring, and an enrichment program
              second-to-none, Kayne Eras is doing what most public schools can't
              - reaching the kids labelled "unteachable.""
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, this amazing fifth grader walks the school halls with a
              confidence and youthful exuberance that evokes a sense of hope and
              optimism. She wants to be a scientist and work for NASA. Her
              teachers have no doubt that the sky is the limit for this
              exceptional young lady.
