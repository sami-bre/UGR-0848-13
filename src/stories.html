          <h2>The story of Jordan</h2>
          <p>
            Jordan was a student in my class during my second year of teaching.
            He'd often refuse to complete activities because he thought they
            were too hard, but I knew he was capable. After all, he was a
            bright, funny, and kind student - he just lacked confidence. I made
            it my mission to change his defeatist mindset over the course of the
            year. I encouraged Jordan, and praised him for his hard work and
            effort at every turn. But when he left my classroom at the end of
            the school year, I was left questioning if I had succeeded in my
            efforts. He had made amazing academic growth, but he still lacked
            confidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Three years later, Jordan came down to my room to visit me. He said,
            "Mr. Boender, you always told me to do my best, and I just want to
            say thank you. Because of you, I am looking at becoming a teacher
            when I grow up."

          <h2>Meet Clyde</h2>
          <p>
            At age 17 with a learning disability, Clyde enrolled at Wisdom
            School with a history of academic struggles and unacceptable
            behaviors. He was often disrespectful to his teachers and peers and
            regularly did not attend class. As a result, he fell far behind in
            his schoolwork and became disengaged with school and was not on a
            path leading to graduation.
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast, at Wisdom School, Clyde flourished. He was surrounded
            by teachers who worked with him one-on-one. They created an
            individualized education plan that prepared him for academic
            success. Clyde felt valued and respected by his teachers in a way he
            never had before.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, Clyde is a model student - he helps other students as a peer
            mentor and will graduate in June.

          <h2>Meet Charmayne</h2>
          <p>
            Charmayne enrolled at Wisdom School in fourth grade. At the time,
            her public school teachers and principals had written her off as
            unreachable and unteachable. “If I stayed at a regular public
            school, I would have gotten kicked out,” recalls Charmayne.
          </p>
          <p>
            But everything began to change when Charmayne got to Wisdom School.
            With a ratio of one staff member to every four students,
            personalized one-on-one counseling, mentoring and tutoring programs,
            and very small class sizes, Charmayne finally received the
            attention, guidance, and nurturing she needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            During her time at Wisdom, Charmayne went from being a young girl
            angry at the world to a young woman who is an accomplished writer,
            dancer, and student with specific goals and plans for her future.

          <h2>Meet Audreona</h2>
          <p>
            Audreona didn't fit in at her neighborhood school. She talked too
            much, asked too many questions, and had trouble controlling her
            impulses. As a result, her teachers decided she was a disruption and
            her classmates teased and bullied her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything changed for Audreona when she transferred to Wisdom
            School. With small class sizes, special attention from teachers,
            access to counselors, tutoring, and an enrichment program
            second-to-none, Kayne Eras is doing what most public schools can't -
            reaching the kids labelled "unteachable.""

          <p>
            Today, this amazing fifth grader walks the school halls with a
            confidence and youthful exuberance that evokes a sense of hope and
            optimism. She wants to be a scientist and work for NASA. Her
            teachers have no doubt that the sky is the limit for this
            exceptional young lady.
