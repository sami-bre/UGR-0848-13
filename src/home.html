        <blockquote>
          Wisdom School is awesome. my kid has never been happier, and I've
          never been more confident! - <em>Dallas Mooney, parent</em>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          Imagine a school where your children eagerly look forward to attending
          every day. - <em>Sameera Kamulkar, parent</em>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          My son was admitted to Legacy School in grade 7. In the small and
          secure environment that the school provided, he transitioned from a
          shy and introverted boy to a confident and happy young adult. -
          <em>Bailee Gibson, parent</em>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          Our 2 sons had studied in 2 schools before they joined Legacy. This
          school was like a breath of fresh air for them, especially after the
          previous school they had been to. - <em> Gilberto Frye, parent</em>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          My son has said specifically "I did't know I could be smart at
          Science” and my daughter said “she is learning things and it is
          sticking in her head.” - <em>Rhianna Spence, parent</em>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          Thanks to Ms Lynne Bates and the whole Team for all the hard work
          towards the development of the School. I am a new parent to this
          school and I find this as a wonderfully disciplined and organised
          school in all aspects. - <em>Abraham Norris, parent</em>
